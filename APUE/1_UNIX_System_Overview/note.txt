S1.3 - Loggin in
    /etc/passwd
    seven colon-separated field:
    -> the login name : encrypted password : numeric user ID : numeric group ID : a comment field : home dir : shell program <-
        e.g. tomcat:x:91:91:Tomcat:/usr/share/tomcat5:/bin/sh
    
    We can use awk to print selected columns:
        awk  -F: '{print $1,$3,$6}' OFS="\t" /etc/passwd

S1.4 - Files and Directories
    The only two characters that cannot appear in filename are the slash character (/) and null character.
    
    A pathname that begins with a slash is called an absolute pathname; otherwise, it's called a relative pathname.

    Use "echo $?" check the exit status of last program

S1.7 - Error Handling
    On Linux, the error constants are listed in the errno(3) manual page .
    Since the value of errno is never cleared by a routine if an error does not occur.
    Therefore, we should examin its value onlu when the return value from a funtion indicates that an error occurred

S1.10 - Time Values
    Two different time values:
    1) Calendar time. Number of seconds from Jan.1, 1970
    2) Process time, measured in clock ticks, as following three:
        Clock time - elapsed time
        User CPU time - CPU time contribute to user instruction
        System CPU time - CPU time attributed to the kernel when it executes on behalf of the process
