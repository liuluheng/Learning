S1.11 64-Bit Architectures
--------------------------
The common programming model for existing 32-bit Unix systems is called the **ILP32** model, denoting that integers(I), long integers(L), and pointers(P) occupy 32 bits

The model that is becoming most prevalent for 64-bit Unix systems is called the LP64 model, meaning only long integers(L) and pointers(P) require 64 bits
