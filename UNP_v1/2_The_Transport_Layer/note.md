2.4 TCP
-------
TCP cannot bere described as a 100% reliable protocol; it provides reliable delivery of data or reliable notification of failure.

**RTT**: round trip time

2.5 SCTP
--------
The word **association** is used in SCTP instead of **connection** to avoid the connotation that a connection invovles communication between only two IP addresses. An association refers to a communication between two systems, which involve more than two addresssssssssssssssses due to multihoming.

2.6 TCP Connection Establishment and Termination
------------------------------------------------
MSS - maximum segment size

If the entire purpose of connection is to send a one-segment request and receive a one-segment reply, there would be eight segments of overhead involved when using TCP.

2.7 TIME_WAIT State
-------------------
MSL - maximum segment lifetime
